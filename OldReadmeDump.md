# SnD

SnD (Search and Destroy) is a now-abandoned minigame which 2 to 10 players are pitted against each other in an arena. All attacks instantly kill, and the last survivor wins.

# BotA/AFFA

BotA/AFFA (Battles of the Arcane / Arcane Free For All) is a now-abandoned game where players fight each other using a different style of PvP involving command block spells and abilities. A year later, I renamed BotA to AFFA and turned the queue 1v1 system into a FFA system, however, it still wasn't long before I dropped the project.

# Conquest

This version of the BotA Project was fun while it lasted, with heavy emphasis on "while it lasted". It's been about 2 months since I last played Minecraft or worked on this, so I figured that it'd be more useful to be out here up for grabs rather than just collecting dust on my computer. Hit me up with any questions if you have any (Discord Server: https://discord.gg/B2Fs58b, Discord Username: WatDuhHekBro#7158), but know that I haven't touched this in quite a while, so it'll pretty much be new to my eyes.

If you want to test out the game, gather a few players and head out to "reeee3expo.minehut.gg" (without the quotes). Know that it requires 2 players to start, and it'll probably have bugs that I'm no longer inclined to fix.
