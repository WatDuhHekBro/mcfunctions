## Brainstorming below
#What do we need to do?
#First, we need to gather 2 random players on the queue list that has the queue tag.
#Then, we teleport them to the chamber and set it to 15 seconds until the battle begins.
#Also on the note, we need to make a entry objective so it doesn't constantly teleport queued players.
