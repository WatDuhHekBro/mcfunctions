# mcfunctions Archive

This is a personal archive of all my mcfunctions of the past. All the different versions are given nice diffs by using git.

## 1.12 Commands

- `wdhb_snd` **(Search and Destroy (SnD)):** A minigame which 2 to 10 players are pitted against each other in an arena. All attacks instantly kill, and the last survivor wins.
	- It has been [rewritten as a Java plugin](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro/ZFactor-Public). Attacks no longer instantly kill, and combat has been replaced with custom combat classes.
- `wdhb_bota` **(BotA (Battles of the Arcane)):** A game where players fight each other using a different style of PvP involving command block spells and abilities.
	- It has been [rewritten as a Java plugin](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro/ZFactor-Public).
- `wdhb_affa` **(AFFA (Arcane Free For All)):** A version of BotA where the 1v1 queue system was turned into a FFA system.
- `horseplay`: What seems to be an attempt to port both SnD and BotA into one world.
- `1.12.2 Functions`: Contains several mcfunctions that were put together to function in one world.
	- **Parasites:** Converts silverfish into parasites that enter mobs, eventually exploding into several more silverfish and repeating the cycle.
	- **Volatile Creepers:** Any creeper may randomly short-circuit and explode on its own.
	- **Temperature:** A rudimentary temperature system based on the biome the player is currently in.

## 1.14 Commands

- `wdhb-arcane`: A couple of magic spells cast in the player's direction made after the release of local coordinates in 1.13+ commands.
- `Conquest` **(originally named BotA+):** A game similar to SWBF2 where players try to capture objectives to decrease the amount of reinforcements on the enemy team and ultimately eliminate them from the arena.
	- Requires a very janky server setup, the datapack alone doesn't function properly.
	- It has been [rewritten as a Java plugin](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro/ZFactor-Public).
- `wdhb-1.14.4`: Some magic spells made for a private vanilla 1.14.4 server.
	- Features a mage that can cycle through many spells.
	- Features a hunter whose main weapon is the trident, and has a special buff when underwater.
