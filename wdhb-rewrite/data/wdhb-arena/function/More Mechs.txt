Decimals being shown in action bar.
Every second/twenty ticks, remove a second from the total. Every two ticks, remove a millisecond/tenth.
The format is (sec).(mil) until you can cast that ability again.
It will not be 1 tick because .05 and .00 is clunky and also there's no way to force a zero.



DQ6 Battle Noteblocks
Mainly iOS version since it's fast paced, but I could use the style/drum setup of the SNES version.
Add a separate scoreboard objective for lobby music and battle music.
Lobby Music: [0: Enabled and actively playing], [1: Disabled], [2: Disabled but will play later]
Battle Music: [0: Enabled, 1: Disabled]
While lobby music is ongoing, battle music always starts exactly the same.
